    question: "What kind of Telegram bots can you build?",
    answer: "I can build a wide range of bots, including e-commerce bots with payment integration, customer support systems, content subscription bots, community management tools, and bots that integrate with any external API or database. If you have an idea, I can most likely build it."
  },
  {
    question: "Which programming languages and frameworks do you use?",
    answer: "I primarily specialize in Python with the `aiogram` library and Node.js with `Telegraf.js`. These are modern, high-performance frameworks that allow for building robust and scalable bots. For databases, I'm proficient with both SQL (like PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (like MongoDB)."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a custom bot cost?",
    answer: "The cost depends on the complexity of the bot. A simple bot might start around $250, while a more complex system with multiple integrations and a custom admin panel will be more. Please use the contact form to send me your project details for a free, no-obligation quote."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to build a bot?",
    answer: "A typical project takes between 1 to 3 weeks from consultation to deployment. This can vary depending on the feature set and my current workload. I always provide a clear timeline before starting any project."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide hosting and maintenance?",
    answer: "Yes, I offer both. My managed hosting service ensures your bot has 99.9% uptime, and I handle all server maintenance and security updates. I also offer monthly maintenance plans for bug fixes and feature updates after the bot is launched."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate my bot with other services or APIs?",
    answer: "Absolutely. I specialize in API integration. I can connect your bot to payment gateways (like Stripe), CRMs, Google Sheets, external databases, or any other service that provides an API."
